# GoPro Setup Guide for Football Analytics

## Optimal Camera Settings

### 1. Resolution and Frame Rate
- **Recommended**: 4K at 30fps or 1080p at 60fps
- **For Analysis**: 1080p at 60fps provides good balance of quality and file size
- **For Highlights**: 4K at 30fps for maximum detail

### 2. Field of View (FOV)
- **Wide**: Captures more of the field but players appear smaller
- **Linear**: Best for analysis as it reduces distortion
- **SuperView**: Maximum coverage but with more distortion

### 3. Additional Settings
- **Stabilization**: Enable HyperSmooth for steady footage
- **Protune**: Enable for better post-processing flexibility
- **ISO**: Keep low (100-400) for less noise
- **Shutter**: 1/120s for 60fps, 1/60s for 30fps
- **EV Compensation**: Adjust based on lighting conditions

## Camera Placement Strategies

### 1. Primary Position: Center Line Elevated
**Location**: Sideline at the center of the field (50-yard line equivalent)
**Height**: 8-12 feet above ground
**Distance**: 15-25 feet from sideline
**Advantages**:
- Covers entire field width
- Good perspective for tactical analysis
- Captures most player interactions

### 2. Secondary Positions

#### Goal Line Position
**Location**: Behind goal, slightly elevated
**Height**: 6-10 feet
**Distance**: 10-20 feet behind goal
**Best for**: Goal detection, goalkeeper analysis, penalty situations

#### Corner Positions
**Location**: Field corners at 45-degree angles
**Height**: 8-12 feet
**Advantages**: Good for corner kicks, throw-ins, overall field coverage

### 3. Multi-Camera Setup (Recommended for Comprehensive Analysis)

#### 3-Camera Setup:
1. **Main Camera**: Center line, elevated (primary tactical view)
2. **Goal Camera 1**: Behind one goal (goal detection)
3. **Goal Camera 2**: Behind opposite goal (goal detection)

#### 5-Camera Setup:
1. **Main Camera**: Center line, elevated
2. **Goal Camera 1**: Behind goal A
3. **Goal Camera 2**: Behind goal B  
4. **Wide Camera**: Elevated corner position
5. **Detail Camera**: Lower sideline for close-up actions

## Equipment Requirements

### Essential Equipment
- GoPro HERO9/10/11/12 (for 5K recording capability)
- Heavy-duty tripod (minimum 8ft extension)
- Extra batteries (4-6 recommended for full match)
- High-speed SD card (128GB minimum, Class 10 or higher)
- Portable power bank or AC adapter

### Recommended Accessories
- Remote control or smartphone app for operation
- Lens protectors (essential for outdoor use)
- Weather protection housing
- Tripod stabilizer weights (for windy conditions)
- Cable ties and clamps for secure mounting

## Field Setup Coordinates (Standard Football Pitch)

### Field Dimensions Reference
- Length: 100-130 yards (90-120m)
- Width: 50-100 yards (45-90m)
- Goal: 8 yards wide × 8 feet high (7.32m × 2.44m)

### Optimal Camera Positions
```
Position 1 (Main): Center line + 20ft back + 10ft high
Coordinates: (Field_Length/2, -20ft, 10ft)

Position 2 (Goal A): Behind goal + 15ft back + 8ft high  
Coordinates: (0, -15ft, 8ft)

Position 3 (Goal B): Behind goal + 15ft back + 8ft high
Coordinates: (Field_Length, -15ft, 8ft)
```

## Camera Calibration for Computer Vision

### Pre-Recording Checklist
1. Record field markers (corners, center circle, penalty areas)
2. Place calibration objects at known distances
3. Record without zoom first, then with desired zoom level
4. Test multiple angles if using pan/tilt

### Calibration Markers to Include
- All four field corners
- Center circle
- Penalty area corners
- Goal posts
- Touchlines and goal lines intersection points

## Recording Best Practices

### Before the Match
1. Arrive 30 minutes early for setup
2. Check battery levels and storage space
3. Test recording quality in current lighting
4. Secure all equipment against weather/wind
5. Record calibration footage

### During the Match
1. Start recording before kickoff
2. Monitor battery levels every 20 minutes  
3. Have backup SD cards ready
4. Check for obstruction by players/officials
5. Adjust zoom for different game phases if needed

### After the Match
1. Stop recording immediately after final whistle
2. Backup footage to multiple locations
3. Note any issues or special events for analysis
4. Clean and store equipment properly

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Players Too Small in Wide Shots
**Solution**: Use 4K recording and crop in post, or use narrower FOV

### Issue: Ball Tracking Difficulties
**Solution**: Higher frame rate (60fps), ensure good lighting, avoid shadows

### Issue: Jersey Numbers Unreadable
**Solution**: Position camera closer or use telephoto lens adapter

### Issue: Camera Shake in Wind
**Solution**: Use tripod weights, lower center of gravity, windscreen

### Issue: Overheating in Hot Weather
**Solution**: Use external power, shade the camera, remove battery when possible

## Post-Processing Preparation
